WALKTHROUGH

The game is a modern adventure in a Swift Land Theme Park. 
Each area of the park is named after an album by Taylor Swift and the trivia quizz is about details related to Taylor Swift's music.
The position of the player at the beginning of the game is in the middle, which is called "Holy Ground".

To move or enter or exit a zone, you enter command "go + directions available". To rest, command "rest". To quit, command "quit".

To answer a trivia, you enter command "answer + the answer that you think may be correct".

To get hints, you enter command "hint". The more hints you ask for, the higher chance is that you may lose the game. 

There are six items available in different zones: scarf, keychain, paper ring, flower, cardigan, flannel shirt. You can only collect them after answering the trivia correctly. You enter command "collect + the item you want".

You can discover the meaning of these items by entering the command "unbox + the item you have and want to see".

To win, you need to reach the "Home" zone with at least 2 items and take fewer than 12 turns.
